# ML_Unsupervised
The project consists of two parts, both leveraging unsupervised learning techniques:

Part 1: This part focused on segmenting cars into categories based on fuel consumption and other key attributes using the K-means clustering technique.

Part 2: This part involved classifying vehicle silhouettes into one of three types using features extracted from the silhouettes. Dimensionality reduction with PCA was applied to identify the most significant features for model development. A Support Vector Machine (SVM) was then used to build the classification model, achieving an accuracy of 89%.
